 * The top half of the address space is reserved for the kernel. This means that 256 top level
 * entries are for the user, and 256 are for the kernel. This will be further split into the
 * 'regular' kernel window, which contains mappings to physical memory, a small (1GiB) higher
 * kernel image window that we use for running the actual kernel from and a top 1GiB window for
 * kernel device mappings. This means that between PPTR_BASE and
 * KERNEL_BASE there are 254 entries remaining, which represents how much physical memory
 * can be used.
 *
 * Almost all of the top 256 kernel entries will contain 1GiB page mappings. The only 2 entries
 * that contain a 2nd level PageTable consisting of 2MiB page entries is the entry
 * for the 1GiB Kernel ELF region and the 1GiB region corresponding to the physical memory
 * of the kernel ELF in the kernel window.  The same 2nd level PageTable is used and so both
 * entries refer to the same 1GiB of physical memory.
 * This means that the 1GiB kernel ELF mapping will correspond to physical memory with a 1GiB
 * alignment.
